                  parents. After college at the University of North Florida I spent time working in
                  foreign missions. An illness in my immediate family called me back home to make
                  them my main mission. After helping my family back to health and perfecting the
                  best latte in the evenings, while holding down a nine to five during the day, I
                  spent much time discerning God's will for my life.

                  currently serve as a parochial vicar in the metro Atlanta area.
