                01. Focus
              </h3>

              <p className="mb-8 max-w-[44.38rem] text-lg">
                Keep your eyes fixed on Christ. Literally. Find an image of
                Jesus, and give yourself time to simply look at Him, and let Him
                look at you. This simple exercise puts{" "}
                <em className="italic">everything</em> in perspective, letting
                Jesus be our focus, and allowing the noise to fade away.

                02. Pray

              <p className="mb-8 max-w-[44.38rem] text-lg">
                This step, while obvious, must still be said. This is a state of
                "being," not a state of "doing." With your eyes fixed on Christ,
                it becomes natural to ask Jesus to reveal Himself in the
                circumstances of your life.

              <p className="mb-8 max-w-[44.38rem] text-lg">
                Expect the unexpected and allow the Lord to enter into your
                surroundings. Very often, we have a specific idea in our minds
                how (and where)Â Christ will come to us. Anticipation is not just
                about seeking out Christ, but allowing ourselves to be found by
                Him.{" "}
